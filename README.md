# SaveToNotionDiscordBot

Current limitations:
- Can only extract first link; limitation of current notion API.
- Only 1 tag can be applied; could add functionality to check if link is already in table (if notion API can) to prevent mutliple entries, and to add more tags to exisiting entry from discord
